In the Week4 of Data Mining Class I have worked on the Decision Tree. I have used the tennis.csv dataset for this activity The Dataset had four attributes named Outlook, Temperature, umidity, Windy, Play Out of the categorical columns available as above I have first calculated the conditional entropy, later found the Information gain between Outlook with respect to Play, Temperature with respect to Play, Humidity with respect to Play , Windy with respect to Play. Later I calculated the accuracy of decision tree. After this step I have calculated the confusion matrix and then calculated the AUC-ROC score and plotted the ROC curve
